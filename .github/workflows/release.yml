            ## Usage
             - Download the release package GameEngine-vX.X.X.zip
             - Extract the package
             - Add the GameEngine-d.dll to your project
             - Link the GameEngine-d.lib to your project
             - Include the headers in your project

            ## Requirements
            - Windows

            ## Dependencies
            All dependencies are statically linked into the DLL, so you don't need to distribute them separately.
            However, you'll need them installed for development:

            ```cmake
            # CMake example
            find_package(SFML 2.6 COMPONENTS graphics window system REQUIRED)
            find_package(ImGui-SFML 2.6 REQUIRED)
            find_package(nlohmann_json 3.11 REQUIRED)
            ```

            ## Package Contents
            - bin/GameEngine-d.dll - Runtime library
            - lib/GameEngine-d.lib - Import library for linking
            - include/ - Header files
